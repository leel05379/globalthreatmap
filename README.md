# Global Threat & Event Intelligence Map

A real-time global situational awareness platform that plots security events, geopolitical developments, and threat indicators on an interactive map. Think of it as an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) command center.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Real-Time Event Mapping** - Plot breaking news events (conflicts, protests, natural disasters) on a world map with color-coded threat levels
- **Interactive Mapbox Map** - Dark-themed map with clustering, heatmap visualization, and smooth navigation
- **Event Feed** - Real-time filterable feed of global events with category and threat level filters
- **Entity Search** - Research organizations, people, countries, and groups using Valyu's intelligence APIs
- **Alert System** - Configure keyword and region-based alerts with real-time notifications

### Country Intelligence

Click on any country to view detailed conflict intelligence:

- **Historical Conflicts** - Wars, military engagements, and conflicts throughout history with dates, opposing parties, and outcomes
- **Current Conflicts** - Ongoing wars, military tensions, border disputes, civil unrest, terrorism threats, and geopolitical tensions
- **Tabbed Interface** - Current conflicts (red-themed) and Historical conflicts (blue-themed) displayed in separate tabs
- **Country Highlighting** - Selected country fills with red color and blinks while loading data
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Conflict data synthesized using Valyu Answer API with cited sources

### Military Bases Layer

Visualize global military presence:

- **US Military Bases** - Displayed as green markers (30+ bases worldwide)
- **NATO Installations** - Displayed as blue markers
- **Base Details** - Click any base to see its name, type, and host country
- **Automatic Loading** - Military base data loads when the map initializes
- **Coverage** - Includes bases in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa, and the Americas

### Map Visualization

- **Auto-Pan Mode** - Play/pause button to automatically pan across the globe
- **Event Clustering** - Group nearby events for cleaner visualization at lower zoom levels
- **Heatmap View** - Toggle heatmap to visualize event density
- **Entity Locations** - When researching entities, their known locations appear as purple markers on the map

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Map**: Mapbox GL JS + react-map-gl
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4 + custom components
- **Intelligence API**: valyu-js (search, answer, deep research)
- **Schema Validation**: zod
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Markdown**: react-markdown + remark-gfm

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Mapbox account and API token
- Valyu API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
VALYU_API_KEY=your_valyu_api_key_here
```

3. Get your API keys:
   - **Mapbox**: [Get a token](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)
   - **Valyu**: [Get an API key](https://valyu.ai)

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

### Interactive Map

- **Click on a Country** - Opens the Country Conflicts Modal showing historical and current conflicts
- **Click on an Event Marker** - Shows event details popup
- **Click on a Military Base** - Shows base name, type (US/NATO), and country
- **Zoom/Pan** - Navigate the map or use auto-pan mode

### Event Feed

The event feed displays real-time global events. You can:
- Filter by threat level (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)
- Filter by category (Conflict, Protest, Disaster, Diplomatic, etc.)
- Search events by keyword
- Click on events to fly to their location on the map

### Auto-Pan Mode

The play/pause button in the bottom-left corner toggles automatic map panning:
- **Play** - Map continuously pans eastward across the globe
- **Pause** - Stops the auto-pan animation

### Entity Search

Search for any organization, country, or group to get:
- Overview and description
- Location markers on the map (headquarters, offices, operations)
- Deep research analysis (optional)
- Related data sources

### Country Conflicts

Click any country on the map to view:
- **Current Tab** (Red) - Active conflicts, military tensions, and ongoing security threats
- **Historical Tab** (Blue) - Past wars and military engagements with dates and outcomes
- **Sources** - Cited references for all conflict information (Wikipedia excluded)

### Alerts

Create alert rules based on:
- Keywords (e.g., "nuclear", "sanctions")
- Threat levels
- Geographic regions (coming soon)

## API Routes
